## Features

- **Simple Protocol:** Implements the Gemini protocol for lightweight and secure communication.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Prioritizes user privacy with minimal data collection.
- **Fast and Lightweight:** Designed for speed and efficiency with minimal resource usage.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new features or customize existing ones.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamJaviya/Gemini-.git
   cd gemini-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:

   ```plaintext
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Configuration

All configuration options are stored in the `.env` file. Here is an example of what the file might look like:

```plaintext
# API Key for authentication
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Port on which the server will run
SERVER_PORT=3000

# Other configuration options can be added here
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add a new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
